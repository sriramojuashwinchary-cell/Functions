        ".Lazy Evaluation: Values are computed only when requested, improving performance and reducing computational overhead when the entire dataset is not immediately needed.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        ".Pipelining: Generators can be chained together to create efficient data processing pipelines. Each generator in the pipeline processes a segment of data, forwarding it to the next stage without holding the entire dataset in memory.\n",

        ".Simplified Code: For complex iteration logic, generators can offer cleaner and more straightforward syntax compared to writing traditional loops, enhancing code clarity.\n",
        "\n",
